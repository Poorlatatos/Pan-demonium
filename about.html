        <h2>About PAN-DEMONIUM</h2>
        <p>PAN-DEMONIUM is a game where it involves elements of cooking inside this game genre.
            The game is made by two developers, both are currently in school as PAN-DEMONIUM is a school project.
            We both hope to expand the game to a full-fledged game in the future, with more levels and recipes.

            While the game is being worked upon, I hope you enjoy the game as it is right now and,
            look through our selection of recipes that we hope can make your culinary life a bit more interesting.

            The game is a simple collection platformer where you collect ingredients to make a dish.
            As of now, there is currently only a single level to the game itself but, there are plans to add more levels in the future.
            Not just that, this game whilst being a prototype, has a lot of potential to be a full-fledged game.
            Especially since the first level itself is quite big.
