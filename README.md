# PAN-DEMONIUM

The overview of our project is that we have developed a website where people can come and cherish the recipes that we have carefully picked out for
anyone to enjoy. That and also learn what ingredients are sutible for what dishes and come to discuss with anyone on our discussion board about
their favourite recipes or share knowledge.

## Design Process

For the design process, I thought about who would be willing to use our website and for that I can generalise a few player groups that
would be keen. To explain this, I will be taking a reference from Gamification Concepts for this to hopefully better explain this.


**Free-Spirits:** These players want to explore the system and use it for self expression, they enjoy using the system,
not so much the premise of the system. Some people are just keen on trying anything for fun or even just to expand their
general knowledge on a certain study/field.

**Socializers:** These players are motivated by interaction. They enjoy engaging with peers, comparing progress on leaderboards,
or sharing achievements. And so for them, we have a discussion board for them to socialize with others across the wide web.

**Self-Seekers:** These players participate only when they see direct benefits, such as rewards, points, or incentives.
Their motivation is extrinsic, and they are less likely to engage deeply with content unless they perceive a personal gain.

**Networkers:** These players want to form social connections, but not because they like to,but to get some form of reward or status

These are the types of people who might come to our website to not just learn but to also widen their perspectives in the culinary field.


## Features

**Web Based Game** - It allows users to play our game and learn about certain ingredients for recipes in a different medium as opposed to just text.

**Recipe Page** - This is the opposite of the Web Based Game, where people who enjoy reading can take upon this opportunity to learn new recipes.

**Discussion Board** - Users can socialize from anypart of the world with one another to come share new ideas for recipes and learn from one another.

## Future Developments 

**Badge and Point System** - We hope to develop a system like that in the future as since we have a profile feature a badge system would certainly entice people
to edit and be more creative with their profiles.

## Technologies Used

**Firebase Database / Firebase Authenthication** - We used it mainly to help with not just the user signup, login and storage, but also to store
and use the discussion of users in our website.

**Lottie** - We just used it for the transition of the animation from webpage to webpage


## Testing

Do note that when booting up from VSC for the seperate recipe pages, they might look un-styled but
this is solely because of GitHub having issues with page links so to cater to that I had to change the webpage links.

So whatever you will see on VSC will look wrong and bad, but please do try to ignore that and just use the GitHub website itself for the actual
testing.

## Credits

I took inspiration from several old 1930s' menus found on the internet and used them as reference for the website's recipe pages.

The game itself was semi-inspired from Mario 64 and the character that is in the game itself is based off Cooking Mama.
